Who can access this repository? - Only those whom are invited to the repository can access and edit it. This should be our entire group, but if you cannot clone/edit the repository message someone who can.
How can you edit this repository - You can clone down this repository from the cloud easily using GitHub Desktop, and any changes you make to that can then be committed and pushed to the cloud.
	Note - Branching: If you are editing the project files (Scripts, scenes, artwork, etc) in a non-minor way, I reccomend creating a new branch until you are finished and the feature works. This will allow the main branch to maintain its integrity, & it should allow for easier merging if a file has been edited by two different people.
